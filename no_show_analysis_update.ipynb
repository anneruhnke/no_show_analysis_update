    "<li>Do no-shows for appointments differ depending on the age of the patient? Hypothesis: Older patients are more responsible and have a lower no-show rate.\n",
    "<li>Do no-shows for appointments differ if patients received an SMS? Hypothesis: Patients that received an SMS are reminded of their appointment and have a lower no-show rate.\n",
    "<li>Do no-shows for appointments differ if patients have a scholarship? Hypothesis: Patients with a scholarship have an insurance and therefore, don't need to worry about the expenses of an appointment and have a lower no-show rate.\n",
    "<li>Do no-shows for appointments differ if the appointment is scheduled way in advance? Hypothesis: Patients that schedule their appointments way in advance, forget about them and have a higher no-show rate."
